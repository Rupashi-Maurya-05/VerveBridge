# Vervebridge-Task1
Task 1 of vervebridge Internship (August 2024) Data Analytics

**Project Overview:** 
NBA Draft Combine Data Analysis (2009-2017)
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of NBA Draft Combine data from 2009 to 2017, focusing on the physical attributes and performance metrics of draft prospects. The primary goal is to uncover key trends, relationships, and factors that influence the draft position of players.

**Key Metrics:**
-Draft Pick
-Height (No shoes)
-Height (With Shoes)
-Wingspan
-Standing Reach
-Weight
-Vertical (Max)
-Body Fat 
-Agility
-Sprint

**Work Flow:**

1. **Data Collection:** Gathered NBA Draft Combine data from 2009-2017, including physical and athletic measurements of prospects.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, ensured data consistency, and converted columns to numeric types.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Performed year-wise trend analysis of average physical metrics.
   - Compared physical features of selected vs. non-selected players.
   - Generated a correlation heatmap to visualize relationships between attributes.
4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created line plots for year-wise trends.
   - Used regression plots to explore meaningful relationships between physical attributes and draft positions.
   - Generated scatter plots and a pair plot for detailed examination of attribute relationships.
5. **Insights and Interpretation:** Extracted key insights on how physical attributes impacted draft positions and their evolution over time.
6. **Conclusion and Reporting:** Summarized findings on the significance of physical attributes in draft outcomes and trends.

# Vervebridge-Task2-Big Game Census Data Visualization
 Task 2 of Vervebridge internship Data Analytics
  Hereâ€™s a **GitHub README** template for your Power BI project:
## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
This project was developed as part of Task 2 for my internship at Vervebridge. The main objective was to analyze NFL player data alongside U.S. Census population estimates to uncover trends and insights related to player birthplaces, success factors, and population-to-player ratios. Using **Power BI**, I created interactive dashboards that provide visual representations of the relationships between player development and geographical population metrics.

## ðŸš€ Key Metrics & Insights
- **Player Birthplace Trends**: Analyzed the distribution of NFL players across different states to identify top talent-producing regions.
- **Population-to-Player Ratio**: Visualized the ratio of population size to the number of NFL players from each state, offering insights into regions with higher representation in the NFL relative to population size.
- **Success by Geography**: Tracked average years played in the NFL by birthplace, providing a geographical perspective on player success.
- **Geospatial Distribution**: Created a choropleth map to show the distribution of players born across different states, along with their respective population estimates.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI**: Main tool for creating dynamic, interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **Python**: Used for data cleaning, preparation, and additional analysis where necessary.
- **Excel**: Source files for population estimates and player data.

## ðŸ”„ Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Two key datasets were used:
     - NFL player data (player birthplaces, positions, and teams)
     - U.S. Census population data (2016 and 2017 estimates for states and places)
   
2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Data was cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency across both datasets (matching state names, removing duplicates, etc.).
   - The datasets were merged on common attributes such as state names and geographic IDs.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Choropleth Maps**: Used to display the distribution of players across the U.S. by state.
   - **Bubble Charts**: Visualized the population-to-player ratio for each state.
   - **Stacked Bar Charts**: Showed player positions by birth state to identify positional trends in different regions.
   - **Line Charts**: Illustrated historical trends of player birthplace and success over time.
